# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      🆕 PHASE 1: BACKEND AUTHENTICATION & USER MANAGEMENT COMPLETED
      
      IMPLEMENTED:
      
      **Authentication System:**
      - JWT-based authentication with 7-day token expiration
      - Password hashing using bcrypt
      - OAuth2PasswordBearer token scheme configured
      - Helper functions: verify_password, get_password_hash, create_access_token
      - Protected route dependencies: get_current_user, get_current_active_user
      
      **Authentication Endpoints:**
      - POST /api/auth/login - User login returning JWT token
      - POST /api/auth/register - Register new user (Admin only, requires authentication)
      - POST /api/auth/init-admin - Initialize default admin (admin@hubblindtests.com / admin123)
      
      **User Management Endpoints:**
      - GET /api/users/me - Get current authenticated user profile
      - GET /api/users - List all users (Admin only)
      - GET /api/users/{user_id} - Get specific user by ID (Admin only)
      - POST /api/users - Create new user (Admin only)
      - PUT /api/users/{user_id} - Update user (Admin only)
      - DELETE /api/users/{user_id} - Delete user with self-deletion prevention (Admin only)
      - GET /api/users/stats/all - Get user statistics including test counts and incident counts
      
      **Models Added:**
      - UserRole enum (admin, agent)
      - User, UserCreate, UserUpdate, UserInDB models
      - Token, TokenData models
      - LoginRequest model
      
      **Security Features:**
      - Role-based access control (RBAC) - Admin vs Agent
      - JWT token validation on protected endpoints
      - Password hashing with bcrypt
      - Self-deletion prevention for admins
      - Active user checking
      
      **Configuration:**
      - SECRET_KEY configurable via environment variable
      - Token expiration: 7 days
      - OAuth2 token URL: /api/auth/login
      
      READY FOR TESTING:
      - All authentication endpoints functional
      - All user management endpoints functional
      - Server started successfully without errors
      - Need to test: login flow, user creation, RBAC, stats endpoint
      
      NEXT STEPS:
      1. Test backend authentication and user management endpoints
      2. Create admin initialization
      3. Build frontend Login page
      4. Build frontend Paramètres page for user management
      5. Build frontend Statistics page
      
      TEST INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENT:
      1. First initialize admin user: POST /api/auth/init-admin
      2. Login as admin: POST /api/auth/login with email/password
      3. Test JWT token authentication on protected endpoints
      4. Test user CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
      5. Test RBAC - ensure admin-only endpoints are protected
      6. Test user statistics endpoint
      7. Verify error handling for invalid credentials, duplicate emails, etc.

#### Backend (`/app/backend/server.py`)
1. ✅ Ajout de la fonction `get_agent_dashboard_stats()` qui retourne des données simplifiées pour les agents
2. ✅ Ajout de la fonction `get_encouragement_message()` qui génère des messages positifs basés sur le nombre de tests
3. ✅ Modification de l'endpoint `/api/stats/dashboard` pour détecter le rôle de l'utilisateur et retourner des données différentes

#### Frontend (`/app/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
1. ✅ Ajout du composant `AgentDashboard` avec un design épuré
2. ✅ Ajout de la logique pour afficher le dashboard agent ou le dashboard normal selon le rôle
3. ✅ Import du contexte d'authentification pour envoyer le token JWT

- **Observations:**
  - Affiche "Mon Espace de Travail" au lieu de "Tableau de bord"
  - Message encourageant : "Bon début ! 1 test effectué ce mois-ci 🎯"
  - 2 cartes simples : "Tests à effectuer ce mois" (235) et "Incidents nécessitant un suivi" (4)
  - Liste des tâches organisée par programme avec badges de type de test (Site/Ligne)
  - Design épuré, tons neutres et positifs
  - Pas de métriques anxiogènes (pas de taux de réussite, retard, comparaisons)

#### Test 2: Dashboard Admin
- **Utilisateur:** admin@hubblindtests.com / admin123
- **Résultat:** ✅ SUCCÈS
- **Observations:**
  - Affiche le dashboard complet traditionnel
  - Toutes les métriques de performance présentes
